# Introduction

Connected learning is an educational framework that connects interests, relationships, and opportunity. This section provides an overview of the concept, including the equity agenda that drives the framework, and introduces ConnectedLib.

> “Connected learning is realized when a young person is able to pursue a personal interest or passion with the support of friends and caring adults, and is in turn able to link this learning and interest to academic achievement, career success or civic engagement.”
-- Mimi Ito et al.<sup>[1](#ft1)</sup>
Connected learning is an educational framework—an approach to creating learning experiences. Connected learning is driven by learners’ interests, supported by their relationships, and oriented towards academic, economic, or civic opportunity.[^1]
